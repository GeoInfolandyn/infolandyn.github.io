                            The autocorrelation function (ACF) was computed for the first 150 lags using the MODIS NDVI time series from 2001 to 2012 obtained from the product MOD09Q1. 
                            The use of this ACF is highly useful to assess the temporal patterns of vegetation over agricultural or forested areas.

                        <div><p>The specific autocorrelation coefficients were generated using the MODIS NDVI time series from 2001 to 2012 obtained from the product MOD09Q1. 
                            From the NDVI autocorrelation function  using MOD09Q1 product can be derived some relevant autocorrelation coefficients for vegetation dynamics assessment. 
                            The identification of these AC values depends on the temporal frequency of satellite images. When using MOD09Q1 MODIS product which consists of 8-day composites, 
                            the annual temporal dependency is measured by the AC value at lag 46. Thus, the most important lags to assess the temporal patterns of vegetation are the AC values 
                            at lags 1, 23, 46, 92 and 138 which measures the temporal dependency of NDVI at 8 days, 6-months, one, two and three years respectively.  Each autocorrelation (AC) 
                            coefficient is calculated according to the following equation: </p>
