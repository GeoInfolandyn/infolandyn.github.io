        <div><p>We proposed a new methodology based on NDVI time series autocorrelation values and machine learning algorithms to assess fallowing 
            temporal patterns across rainfed agricultural areas that was tested in mainland Spain. We found that approximately half of rainfed 
            agricultural areas were regularly cultivated (RC) and distributed mainly in the north- western Spain whereas lands with crop-fallow
            rotation patterns every two (CF-2) and three years (CF-3) were distributed across northeast, center and south of Spain. 
            You can see the spatial distribution in the map viewer below <br>
